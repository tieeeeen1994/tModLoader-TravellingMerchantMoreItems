The mod makes the Travelling Merchant sell more items... for a price. This will make the accessories to crafting the Cell Phone and Architect Gizmo Pack more accessible.

It works by allowing the vanilla bnehavior to run through the logic of adding the randomized items to travelling Merchant's menu. Next, this mod will check if the accessories are available or not. If they are not available, the mod will add them to the shop and triple their cost.

The mod has extra configuration to make it customizable depending on the playthrough, such as Ammo Box and Celestial magnet getting the same behaviour in the Travelling merchant's shop.

It can be configured to change the multiplied cost instead of triple the cost.

It also has extra features like making the Goblin Tinkerer sell Toolbox and Merchant sell the Music Box instead of the Wizard.
